List Retrieve all bank integrations available. Method: def list () -> Generator : ... Example: # Retrieve all institutions institutions = client . Institutions . list () Warning: The .list() method yields a Generator , you will have to iterate over it or cast it to List or Tuple . Links Links an end-user identity with a bank entity. Registering a new Link To register a Link you must provide: institution, username and password . Optionally you can also provide a token (for MFA) and a secret (that will be used to safely encrypt and decrypt the password). The Link will only be registered if the provided credentials are valid and will be validated by authenticating against the specified bank.

Belvo API doesn't store passwords in plain text, neither does store custom secrets. Keep your custom encryption_key safe. Don't loose it. Deleting links A Link is persisted into our database when you register it, if you want you can delete it at any time and data related to the Link will be also deleted.

Accounts Bank accounts available for a link. Fetching accounts To fetch accounts you will make use of the .create() method, the process will retrieve all account data available from the bank institution. You must provide a Link .

Transactions Bank transactions made in a bank account. Fetching transactions To fetch transactions you will make use of the .create() method, the process will retrieve all transaction data available from the bank institution.
